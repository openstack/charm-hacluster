      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  corosync_mcastaddr:
    type: string
    default: 226.94.1.1

      Multicast IP address to use for exchanging messages over the network.
      If multiple clusters are on the same bindnetaddr network, this value
      can be changed.

      This value will become the Corosync authentication key. To generate
      a suitable value use:
      .
        sudo corosync-keygen
        sudo cat /etc/corosync/authkey | base64 -w 0
      .
      This configuration element is mandatory and the service will fail on
      install if it is not provided.  The value must be base64 encoded.
  stonith_enabled:
    type: string
    default: 'False'
    description: |
      Enable resource fencing (aka STONITH) for every node in the cluster.
      This requires MAAS credentials be provided and each node's power
      parameters are properly configured in its invenvory.

       The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
       option.
       Used when service_dns is set on the primary charm for DNS HA
  cluster_count:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Number of peer units required to bootstrap cluster services.
      .
      If less that 3 is specified, the cluster will be configured to
      ignore any quorum problems; with 3 or more units, quorum will be
      enforced and services will be stopped in the event of a loss
      of quorum.
  monitor_host:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      One or more IPs, separated by space, that will be used as a saftey check

      resources (VIP, shared disk...).
  monitor_interval:
    type: string
    default: 5s

    default:
    description: |
      Specifies the corosync.conf network mtu. If unset, the default

      detailed information on this config option.
  corosync_transport:
    type: string

    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
          juju-postgresql-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
